> Demo project with packaging setup for React components & Node.

- The project root contains a React component written with TypeScript and Sass, built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), along with a small demo site.
- The `node-fancy-tbx` folder contains a very simple example of a Node module written in TypeScript, built with [swc](https://swc.rs/)
